# Brainstorming

1. What's your idea? Sketch out titles, words, images in your notebook
2. What's your title and maybe a one-sentence description like "A game about..."
3. What are the areas of your game? These could be levels, rooms, regions, different moments in time, etc. These are your main pages that will link together with passages.

# Note: There are 2 main versions of Twine

* Twine 1.0 has been around for about 5 years with steady improvement
* Twine 2.0 (and improvements) was published in February 2015. It looks nice but is buggy! Many people use the old Twine 1.0 because of this! When looking for help, make sure you note the differences between Twine 1.0 and Twine 2.0!
* **Which version should you use?** If you are just doing text and maybe some minimal other things (CSS styling, for example) or you know how to code, then Twine 2.0 is fine.
* If you are starting out or want to easily use extended features (audio, video, etc) then maybe stick to Twine 1.0!

# How to build a Twine game?

1. Start twine-ing! Go to [[twinery.org]](http://twinery.org) and use the downloadable Twine app (open the index.html file) or use it online.
2. Create a title and click the +Passage button in the bottom right to open a screen to create your first room/area.
3. Start typing your first intro screen. Create a title and write the text and click on the rocket button to make it your start page (online version of Twine 2.0.6)
4. A Twine story is built out of passages! Make pages and links!
5. Make sure you are saving and exporting your story often!

### Passages (like your levels)
* Enclose passages in double brackets ```[[This is a passage]]```
* Readers can see one word/phrase but jump to a different page if you write it like this ```[[Words in your story|Page You want to Jump To]]

### Images
* In Twine 2.0, read the [[documentation]](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:add_an_image_movie_sound_effect_or_music). The basics for Twine 2.0 are:
* * Upload your images somewhere like dropbox and get their links
* * Use them in your passage like this. ```<img src="the URL of your image" width="500" height="300" alt="Two foxes">```
* In Twine 1.0, drag into twine or Story -> Import
* Use images with ```[img[The Name of the Image]]```
* More ways to use images [here](http://twinery.org/wiki/image).

### Optional: Styling

* [Style with CSS](http://twinery.org/wiki/stylesheet)
* [Use variables](http://twinery.org/wiki/expression)
* Lots more info in the [documentation](http://twinery.org/wiki/)

### Share Your Twine

* Select Build -> Build Story to turn your Twine into an HTML file.
* Put your twine game in dropbox, on neocities, your own server/website, or post to [philome](http://philome.la/)

# Jam Session / Mini Twine Game

* Let's follow the [Twiny Jam](https://itch.io/jam/twiny) rules and make games with less than 300 words
* Brainstorm / doodle an idea. What are some levels/rooms/areas?
* Or just start writing!
